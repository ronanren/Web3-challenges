# Build an NFT-powered fully on-chain DAO to invest in NFT collections as a group

## üìù Requirements

- Anyone who owns a CryptoDevs NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace
- Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals
- Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal
- Voters cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT
- If majority of the voters vote in favor of the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase happens automatically from the marketplace
